## About Me

My name is Amir Hajimohamdi, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the esteemed University of Tehran. My passion for the field of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is what led me to pursue this program of study. As such, I am eager to further advance my knowledge and expertise in these areas.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable practical experience through various professional and academic endeavors. I recently completed an internship at Asre Danesh Afzar, where I served as an AI Engineer. During my tenure, I developed a text classification model that successfully classified bank transaction types with a high degree of accuracy. This experience helped me to sharpen my skills in machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and natural language processing.

Furthermore, I had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Tehran, where I gained valuable teaching and leadership experience. As a TA, I assisted in teaching a number of courses in Computer Engineering, and was responsible for grading student assignments and providing additional support to students as needed.

My passion for Computer Science and AI is further reflected in the projects that I have undertaken both as part of my academic coursework and on my own. Some of the notable projects are detailed in my resume.

I invite you to peruse my full resume for a more comprehensive overview of my academic and professional experiences. Thank you for your time and consideration.
